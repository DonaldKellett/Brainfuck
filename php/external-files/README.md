# External Files

The files contained in this folder are taken elsewhere from the Internet and therefore I do **NOT** claim any ownership to them.  Therefore, it follows that all the contents of this folder are **NOT** under *my* MIT License (although they may be under another license by someone else).  The only reason I included these files here in the first place is for testing purposes.  If you believe this to be a breach of copyright (or license terms) in any way, please *do* feel free to contact me and explain the issue so I may take appropriate action.
